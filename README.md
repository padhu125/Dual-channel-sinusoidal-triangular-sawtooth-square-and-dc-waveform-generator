The primary objective of this project is to develop a dual-channel waveform generator, controllable and configurable through an AXI4-lite interface from the processor subsystem. The system utilizes an MCP4822 DAC with a 2.048V internal reference, enabling the creation of two distinct waveforms within a voltage range of +/-2.5V at frequencies up to 50 kHz. The DAC outputs are processed through a reconstruction filter and level-shifting/gain stages, achieving a +/-2.5V range. The entire setup is powered by a +/-3.3V supply derived from the Blackboard, incorporating an ICL7660 charge pump.

The MCP4822 DAC, with connections to ~CS, SDI, SCK, and ~LDAC, is complemented by an op amp (TLV2372) for signal level shifting and gain. Bypassed with 0.1uF capacitors, the DAC outputs undergo further processing through an op amp, ensuring compatibility with the desired voltage range.

The project employs a -3.3V power rail generated by an ICL7660 charge pump, facilitated by 10uF capacitors on the switched energy element, input, and output rails.
